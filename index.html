            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>Currently, I'm a Digital Engineering Analyst, DevOps SRE working for NTT Data.
              I consider myself to be an extremely detail oriented person.
              Those who know me would say I am an incredibly fast learner and enjoy pushing myself
              to take on new challenges. Throughout my life I've had the opportunity to play elite level hockey.
              With these opportunities, I've developed into an excellent team member. Programming is my passion,
              I love learning new languages and trying to perfect the details and tiny nuances of them.</p>
