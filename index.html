            <h3>About me</h3>
            <p>Currently, I'm a Digital Engineering Analyst, DevOps SRE working for NTT Data.
              I consider myself to be an extremely detail oriented person.
              Those who know me would say I am an incredibly fast learner and enjoy pushing myself
              to take on new challenges. Throughout my life I've had the opportunity to play elite level hockey.
              With these opportunities, I've developed into an excellent team member. Programming is my passion,
              I love learning new languages and trying to perfect the details and tiny nuances of them.</p>

              <p>
                <br>
                I took this course to learn more about Full-Stack Web development. With a current high demand and strong interest in this side of programming,
                I took the course to make myself and even more desirable candidate to any company. I created this websit after only completing an eigth of the course
                material because I was too excited to wait. This course has made me well rounded in all the tools that are required for Full-Stack Development:
                HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node, React, MongoDB, Web3 and DApps.

              <p>
                <br>
                During my time at school, I balanced a full academic schedule, Jr. B hockey career, and part-time job as a student researcher while maintaining a 3.7 GPA.
                I graduated with distinction in my degree, where I was one of three students in my gradtuating class who took a Joint Advanced Major,
                and the only person in my school to take both Mathematics and Computer Science. I guess you could say I enjoy taking the road less travled.
                All my life I've enjoyed challenging myself to do things others haven't, to be my true authentic self, no matter how difficult the challenge may be.
                I believe that my unique education has made me an ideal candidate for any company as I've learned to become resourcefull and self-sufficient.

                If you read my "three things about me" earlier, you're probably wondering why I only have one highschool listed. What feels like a lifetime ago,
                I was an elite level hockey player and was fortunate enough to be drafted to the QMJHL at age 16. Naturally, like any normal kid at this age (sarcasm btw),
                I moved out from home and persued my dreams of playing in the NHL. Over the course of my highschool career, I transfered between four different schools
                as I hopped from team to team, province to province. During this time, I prioritized my school over hockey, unlike some of my teammates. I was able to graduate
                with high honours and a focus in sciences. Because I technically was first enrolled and then graduated from Chalres P. Allen, my transcript only has
                this one school listed, despite my attendance at others.

                <br>
                Worked with a professor on campus focusing on simulation model development for overdose prevention and COVID-19 spread. Built a testing
                framework to ensure accuracy and runtime for simulation models in MATLAB. Additionally, I reduced runtime by 30% for numerous simulation
                models by utilizing data structures and algorithms. Finally, I debugged and implemented detailed code for derived integrated variables from live data.
